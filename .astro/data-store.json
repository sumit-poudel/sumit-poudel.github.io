No roadmap, no hand-holding—just me and the terminal. I told myself I’d daily drive it. Sink or swim. And at first, it felt like drowning.  \r\n\r\nBroken configs. Missing packages. Endless updates. Every day was a new puzzle. But that’s what made Arch different: **it forces you to learn**.  \r\n\r\n## Discovering the AUR  \r\n\r\nThen I stumbled upon the **AUR (Arch User Repository)**. It felt like unlocking a hidden level. Suddenly, Arch wasn’t just about installing what others had made. It was about *building, shaping, and contributing*.  \r\n\r\nAnd that’s when the idea hit me—what if I could put my own app there?  \r\n\r\n## Wrestling With PKGBUILD  \r\n\r\nI had an Electron app image. No clue how to turn it into a package. So I opened the Electron docs. Found some random guy’s PKGBUILD on GitHub. Copied. Tweaked. Failed.  \r\n\r\nOver and over.  \r\n\r\nMissing dependencies. Wrong paths. Broken installs. Every error felt like the system was laughing at me. But with each failure, I learned. Slowly, painfully, the puzzle started to make sense.  \r\n\r\n## The Moment It Worked  \r\n\r\nAfter countless retries, I ran the build again. This time, no red errors. Installed clean. Launched smooth.  \r\n\r\n**My first AUR package.**  \r\n\r\nIt was more than just code running—it was proof. Proof that I could bend Arch to my will. Proof that struggle builds weight.  \r\n\r\n## Why It Mattered  \r\n\r\nArch taught me this:  \r\n- **Light wins come fast but vanish fast.**  \r\n- **Heavy wins shape you.**  \r\n\r\nAnd that first AUR package? It was heavy. It carried all my failed attempts, all the frustration, all the learning.  \r\n\r\nIn that moment, I wasn’t just using Arch.  \r\n**I became someone who could create for it.**","src/content/blog/1-my-ownAUR.md",[27],"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ui_Shigure#/media/File:Ui_Shigure.jpg","122b24083f72028e",{"html":30,"metadata":31},"\u003Ch1 id=\"owte\">oWtE.\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>My first aur repo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe my last as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumit-poudel/oWtE/master/owte.gif\" alt=\"oWtE girl.\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"diving-into-arch-with-no-clue\">Diving Into Arch With No Clue\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I jumped into Arch Linux with \u003Cstrong>zero idea\u003C/strong> what I was doing.
