## From Chaos to Custom — My Hyprland Journey

![oWtE girl.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumit-poudel/dotfiles/main/assets/look.png)

When I first booted into **HyDE + Hyprland**, I had no clue how deep the rabbit hole went.  
Everything looked barebones. No panels, no menus, no polish. Just a tiling compositor staring back at me.  

I wanted to daily-drive it, but at the start it was a mess. Configs breaking, keybinds missing, windows tiling in ways I didn’t understand. It felt like living in a half-finished house.

## Hunting for Dotfiles

That’s when I did what every Hyprland beginner does—**stole dotfiles**.  

- Picked up some configs from my senior **Biijesh**.  
- Borrowed pieces from **Caelestia dot**.  
- Dug through **Gaurav’s simple-hyprland** setup.  
- Glued it all together with random snippets from GitHub and Reddit.  

Every import broke something new. Wrong paths, weird dependencies, mismatched versions. But that’s how I learned. Each config line was a lesson in how Hyprland ticks.

## Building My Own Setup

Slowly, I stopped just copying. I started shaping.  

- **Waybar** for the status bar.  
- **Wlogout** for session management.  
- **swww** and **mpvpaper** for wallpapers.  
- **Swaync** for notifications.  
- **Tofi** as a fast, minimal launcher.  

Piece by piece, I bent Hyprland to my workflow. My desktop stopped feeling like a borrowed skin and started feeling like mine.

## Why It Mattered

Hyprland taught me something Arch once did:  

- **Copying gets you started. Creating keeps you going.**  
- **Every crash log is a roadmap.**  

What began as scattered dotfiles turned into my own system. Not perfect, not final, but mine.  

In that moment, I wasn’t just *using* Hyprland.  
**I was building my own environment on it.**
